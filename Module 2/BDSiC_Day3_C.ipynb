    "\n",
    "For instance, files can contain **hidden** characters such as **\\n** (which means start a newline) which need to be removed. A straightforward way to do this is to use the string method: **`.rstrip(\"\\n\")`**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a separate method for removing hidden characters from the left side of the string called `.lstrip()`. However, that generally isn't relevant for I/O so I mention it merely for completeness."
