    "## String Methods\n",
    "There are **methods** and **attributes** that are associated with strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can only use methods (functions) with the data type that they are associated with. String methods manipulate the string data type. You can check Python's documentation for the [full list of string methods](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, even more straightforward, you can use the tab after the '.' to discover the methods associated with a type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly useful methods include: **find, lower, upper, replace, rstrip, strip, find, count**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tangentially, we can **turn other types of data into strings** by using the str() function. This is a feature that we will use really really often and usually in the circumstance of wanting to print a concatenated version of output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that **STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE BUT YET THEY HAVE METHODS** will make you feel uncomfortable. Sorry. "
